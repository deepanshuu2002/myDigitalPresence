# Deepanshu's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you.

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Deepanshu, currently pursuing a BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. Originally from Faridabad, Haryana, I'm passionate about both technology and competition.

When I'm not tackling complex engineering concepts, I can be found flexing my coding muscles as a web developer. Building and creating things on the web fuels my creativity. Additionally, I thrive in the challenge of competitive programming, constantly pushing myself to develop efficient solutions to problems. This combination of ECE expertise, web development skills, and competitive programming spirit allows me to approach problems from a unique and multifaceted perspective. I'm always eager to learn new things and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for technology.
